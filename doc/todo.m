% some functions to write
pce_field_expand
pce_field_expand_gaussian
pce_field_expand_lognormal?
kl_pce_field_expand
kl_pce_field_expand_gaussian
kl_pce_moments->mean,var


%
preconditioners: use ilu, also invmean, and zabaras
examine number of iterations as function of prec type


% 
implement neumann bc

% 
for cg: add tracking of res accuracy
    
%
comparison with monte carlo (partly done)
l2 norm diff with smolyak

% parameter stuff
get_param % whick workspace? separate functions? integration with autoloader; cache_script
