% DOC_IDEAS Contains some ideas that are underlying or should be implemented in SGLIB.
%   
%   * Idea 1: Freedom of the user: use whatever other framework you like,
%             make everything in and out explicit
%   * Idea 2: Separate functions into public and private interface. Public
%             has all the option passing and consistency checking, and in
%             private is the pure algorithm.
